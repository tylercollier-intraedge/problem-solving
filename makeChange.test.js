// Write a function that will make change for a dollar. You're given an integer representing the
// cost, which will be between 1 and 99 inclusive, and you should make change using as few coins
// as possible. Return the change as an array of coins represented by integers. E.g. if you are
// given the number 85, you would return [10, 5].
